Aircraft damage detection is essential for maintaining the safety and longevity of aircraft. 
Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. 
This project aims to automate the classification of aircraft damage into two categories: "dent" and "crack." For this, 
I will utilize feature extraction with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify the damage from aircraft images. 
Additionally, I will use a pre-trained Transformer model to generate captions and summaries for the images.
